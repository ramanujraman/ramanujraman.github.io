title: "Some Ideas"
---
Here are some ideas which are floating around in my head. They may or may not be fully formed, I may or may not pursue them, but I want to
write them down before they are lost. These ideas could be related to physics, programming, or anything else that interests me. Feel free to
reach out if any of these ideas resonate with you! and you want to discuss or collaborate on them.
